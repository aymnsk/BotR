# BotR 🚀

**AI-Powered Algorithmic Trading Bot for Low-Spec Devices**

BotR is an **open-source trading bot framework** designed to run efficiently on low-spec machines while leveraging AI and algorithmic strategies to make trade decisions in financial markets (crypto, stocks, forex). It is built in Rust for performance and reliability, with modular components for future expansion.

## 🧠 Project Overview

BotR aims to provide:

- **Lightweight AI trading logic** optimized for devices with limited CPU/RAM
- **Modular strategy support**
- **Secure API integration with exchange providers**
- **Real-time and paper trading modes**
- **Safe and simple configuration via environment variables**
- **Cross-platform support (Linux / Windows / macOS)**

## 📌 Key Features

✔ Efficient performance — built with Rust  
✔ AI-driven decision logic for market trend evaluation  
✔ Algorithmic strategies (moving averages, signals, etc.)  
✔ Support for both live and simulated trading  
✔ Easy configuration via `.env`  
✔ Logging and backtesting support

## 🧩 How It Works

BotR continuously:

1. Fetches **latest price and ticker data**
2. Applies **AI-assisted signals or indicators**
3. Evaluates buy/sell exit rules
4. Executes trades via exchange APIs
5. Logs results and performance summaries

This creates a complete automated trading loop for systematic decision-making.
